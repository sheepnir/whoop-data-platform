## How to Help Me

### When Writing Code:
1. **Always provide complete, production-ready code** - not pseudocode or partial snippets
2. **Include comprehensive comments and explanations** - explain logic, decisions, and patterns used
3. **Add detailed docstrings** - every function/class should explain purpose, parameters, returns, and examples
4. **Include error handling** with specific exception types and helpful error messages
5. **Include logging statements** for debugging and monitoring with appropriate log levels
6. **Follow these standards:**
   - Python: PEP 8, type hints, docstrings, async/await where beneficial
   - SQL: Clear formatting, CTEs over subqueries, meaningful aliases, window functions
   - dbt: Jinja best practices, proper ref() usage, config blocks, incremental strategies
7. **Show the full file** when creating new files - include all imports, functions, classes, and necessary code
8. **Provide file paths** - always tell me exactly where to create or modify files in the repo structure
9. **Add inline comments** explaining:
   - Complex logic or algorithms
   - Business rules or constraints
   - Performance considerations
   - Security considerations
   - Why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives

### Code Comment Style Examples:

**Python Example:**
```python
def calculate_recovery_score(hrv: float, rhr: int, sleep_hours: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate a normalized recovery score based on key biometric indicators.
    
    This function implements a weighted scoring algorithm that combines HRV,
    resting heart rate, and sleep duration to produce a 0-100 recovery score.
    The weights are based on research showing HRV as the strongest predictor
    of recovery status.
    
    Args:
        hrv: Heart rate variability in milliseconds (typically 20-200ms)
        rhr: Resting heart rate in beats per minute (typically 40-100bpm)
        sleep_hours: Total sleep duration in hours (typically 4-12hrs)
    
    Returns:
        float: Recovery score from 0-100, where higher is better
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_recovery_score(hrv=75, rhr=55, sleep_hours=7.5)
        82.3
    
    Note:
        This is a simplified model. Production systems should use ML models
        trained on individual baselines and historical data.
    """
    # Normalize HRV to 0-1 scale (higher is better)
    # Using min-max normalization with typical HRV range
    hrv_normalized = (hrv - 20) / (200 - 20)  # Maps 20-200ms to 0-1
    
    # Normalize RHR to 0-1 scale (lower is better, so we invert)
    # Typical range is 40-100 bpm
    rhr_normalized = 1 - ((rhr - 40) / (100 - 40))  # Maps 40-100bpm to 1-0
    
    # Normalize sleep to 0-1 scale with optimal range
    # Sleep score peaks at 8 hours and drops off above/below
    sleep_optimal = 8.0
    sleep_normalized = 1 - (abs(sleep_hours - sleep_optimal) / sleep_optimal)
    
    # Weighted combination based on recovery importance
    # HRV is weighted heaviest as strongest predictor (50%)
    # RHR and sleep are secondary indicators (25% each)
    recovery_score = (
        0.50 * hrv_normalized +    # HRV contributes 50% of score
        0.25 * rhr_normalized +    # RHR contributes 25% of score
        0.25 * sleep_normalized    # Sleep contributes 25% of score
    ) * 100  # Convert to 0-100 scale
    
    # Clamp to valid range (handle edge cases)
    return max(0, min(100, recovery_score))
```

**SQL/dbt Example:**
```sql
-- models/gold/fact_daily_recovery.sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='incremental',
        unique_key='recovery_id',
        on_schema_change='fail',
        tags=['gold', 'fact', 'recovery']
    )
}}

/*
 * Fact Table: Daily Recovery Metrics
 * 
 * Purpose: Stores one record per day per user with comprehensive recovery metrics
 * Grain: One row per cycle_id (WHOOP's daily cycle identifier)
 * 
 * Incremental Strategy: Append new records based on cycle_id
 * This approach prevents duplicates while allowing historical corrections
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 *   - silver.stg_recovery: Cleansed recovery data from WHOOP API
 *   - gold.dim_date: Date dimension for time-based analysis
 * 
 * Business Rules:
 *   - Recovery score must be between 0-100
 *   - HRV must be positive (in milliseconds)
 *   - Resting heart rate typically 40-100 bpm for adults

---

## Specific Project Guidance

### Modern Architecture Emphasis:
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Everything should be codified (Terraform, ARM templates)
- **Declarative over Imperative:** Use dbt, YAML configs, SQL over procedural code where possible
- **Immutable Infrastructure:** No manual changes, all via code and deployment pipelines
- **Observability First:** Logging, monitoring, and alerting from day one
- **Security by Design:** Least privilege, secrets management, encryption at rest/transit
- **Cost Awareness:** Resource tagging, auto-scaling, spot instances where appropriate
- **Event-Driven Patterns:** Decouple components, use triggers and events
- **Idempotent Operations:** All data operations should be safely rerunnable

### Snowflake Modern Practices:
- **Teach me Snowflake features** as we use them with modern context
- **Zero-Copy Cloning:** Use for dev/test environments instead of duplicating data
- **Time Travel:** Leverage for data recovery and auditing (explain retention policies)
- **Query Result Caching:** Understand automatic optimization for repeated queries
- **Clustering Keys:** When and why to use them (cost vs. performance trade-off)
- **Materialized Views vs. Dynamic Tables:** Modern approach to derived data
- **Snowpark:** Modern alternative to external Python processing
- **Tasks & Streams:** Native orchestration vs. external tools
- **Secure Data Sharing:** Modern alternative to ETL for data distribution
- **Resource Monitors:** Proactive cost management

### Azure Modern Practices:
- **Serverless-First:** Azure Functions over VMs when possible
- **Managed Services:** Use PaaS over IaaS (Data Factory, Key Vault)
- **Container-Based:** Consider Azure Container Instances for complex workflows
- **Event Grid:** Event-driven architecture for pipeline triggers
- **Managed Identity:** No credentials in code, use Azure AD authentication
- **Private Endpoints:** Secure networking for data services
- **Cost Management:** Tags, budgets, alerts from the start

### dbt Modern Best Practices:
- **Modular Design:** Small, focused models that do one thing well
- **Incremental Strategies:** Use appropriate strategy (append, merge, delete+insert)
- **Jinja Macros:** DRY principle - reuse logic across models
- **dbt Packages:** Leverage community packages (dbt_utils, dbt_expectations)
- **Testing Strategy:** Generic tests + singular tests + custom data quality tests
- **Documentation:** Inline YAML docs, auto-generated data catalog
- **Slim CI:** Only test changed models in CI/CD pipeline
- **Artifacts:** Use artifacts for lineage and cross-project refs

### Code Quality & Modern Standards:
- **Type Hints Everywhere:** Python 3.10+ type hints for better IDE support
- **Async/Await:** Use for I/O-bound operations (API calls, file operations)
- **Dataclasses/Pydantic:** Modern Python data validation and serialization
- **Context Managers:** Proper resource management (with statements)
- **F-strings:** Modern string formatting
- **Pathlib:** Modern path handling over os.path
- **Poetry/pipenv:** Modern dependency management
- **Black/Ruff:** Automated code formatting and linting
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Catch issues before they reach repo
- **Comprehensive Tests:** Unit, integration, and data quality tests

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't give incomplete code snippets - show full implementations
- ❌ Don't use placeholder comments like "# Add error handling here" - actually add it
- ❌ Don't skip explaining complex concepts - break them down
- ❌ Don't assume I know all the tools - teach me as we go
- ❌ Don't provide outdated approaches - use modern best practices (async, type hints, cloud-native)
- ❌ Don't forget to mention where files should be created
- ❌ Don't skip comments - add detailed inline comments and docstrings
- ❌ Don't ignore modern architecture patterns - emphasize event-driven, serverless, declarative approaches
- ❌ Don't overlook observability - include logging, monitoring, alerting considerations
- ❌ Don't forget security - mention secrets management, least privilege, encryption

---

## Module Workflow

When starting a new module:
1. **Review objectives** - Summarize what we'll accomplish with modern architecture context
2. **Check prerequisites** - Verify previous modules are complete
3. **Break into steps** - Show clear, numbered steps with modern tooling
4. **Provide all code** - Complete, runnable, well-commented code
5. **Explain modern patterns** - Why we're using this approach in modern data platforms
6. **Test as we go** - Show how to verify each step works
7. **Document** - Update README and docs as we progress
8. **Commit strategy** - Suggest when to commit with semantic commit messages

### For SQL/dbt Models:
```sql
-- Model: model_name.sql
-- Purpose: What this model does and why
-- Depends on: Upstream dependencies
-- Grain: What does one row represent
-- Modern patterns: Incremental strategy, clustering, etc.

{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',  -- Why incremental vs table/view
    unique_key='id',             -- How we ensure idempotency
    cluster_by=['date'],         -- Performance optimization
    tags=['domain', 'layer']     -- Organization and selective runs
) }}

-- Full SQL with CTEs, window functions, and clear structure
-- Inline comments explaining business logic
-- Performance considerations noted
```

## Project Priorities

1. **Make it work first** - Get a working MVP with modern patterns
2. **Make it right** - Refactor for quality and best practices
3. **Make it observable** - Add logging, monitoring, alerting
4. **Make it secure** - Implement proper security controls
5. **Make it production-ready** - Error handling, documentation, testing
6. **Make it fast** - Optimize performance where needed

## Learning Goals

Help me understand:
- Why we choose specific tools or modern patterns
- How this would work at enterprise scale with cloud-native architecture
- What production considerations matter (observability, security, cost)
- How to troubleshoot when things break using modern tooling
- Industry best practices and modern architecture standards
- Modern data platform patterns (data mesh, data fabric, lakehouse)
